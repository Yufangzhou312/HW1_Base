# Homework Set 1 [Due by 09/18 Mon 11 PM, Individual]: 

Assume that you keep throwing a coin (H/T probabilitly p/q=1-p) __until you get two heads in a row__? Write a python function to compute this expected number of coin throw using __Monte Carlo__ method. Get one answer by averaging N simulations, and obtain M answers. Get the mean and standard deviation increasing N with fixed M (e.g. say M=1000).

You can find the true answer for p=q=0.5 in the [HW answer](https://github.com/PHBS/2016.M3.StoFin/blob/master/files/StoFin_HW_Solution.pdf) of Stochastic finance course. You can easily generalize for general p/q.
